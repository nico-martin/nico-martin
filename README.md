### Hello, my name is Nico.

I'm a frontend developer and founder of say hello, a digital agency focused on modern web developement and WordPress. Right now I am also freelancing for Valtech, where I am am working on a client portal in the e-banking area based on React.

I am also a huge fan of modern web development, which includes topics like new browser capabilities (progressive web apps), frameworks (React and VueJS) as well as semantic HTML and accessibility.
