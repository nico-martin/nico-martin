# Hello, my name is Nico.

I'm a [frontend developer](https://nico.dev) and Google Developer Expert for Web and AI/ML from switzerland.  
Right now I am working for [aity AG](https://www.aity.ch/), where we create digital finance solutions mainly for [Berner Kantonalbank](https://www.bekb.ch/).

I am also a huge fan of modern web development, which includes topics like new browser capabilities (progressive web apps), frameworks ([Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [VueJS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)) as well as semantic HTML, accessibility an on-device AI.
